How to use this stuff
</h3>
To be honest idk
<h4>What are all those files?</h4>
The only file you should care about is main.py
<h4>How to launch this:</h4>
launch main.py <br>
if it throws Errors then launch the required.py <br>
if it still throws Errors and it works that's fine i gues <br>
if it still throws Errors and it doesn't work than that's bad and idk how to solve it <br>
